        <h2> ABOUT ME
        </h2>
            <p class="about"> I am the first-born in a family of 5. Both my parents took computer-related course in college:hence, with their influence and my desire to know more about it, I took one too. I don't have much to brag but I am very proud on who I am today, because of the people that stood and is still beside me. <br> <br> Depending on my mood, I usually spend my days watching anime or movies, reading novels or manga, and solving Rubiks cubes (not just the 3x3, by rubiks cubes I mean the pyraminx, mirror cube, windmill cube and the likes). I also earned a lockdown hobby which is knitting, crocheting, and buying stuffs I know I would barely use.</p>

        <h2> HOW CAN I COMPETE IN THE INDUSTRY?
      </h2>
            <p class="about">
            I know a fair amount in the industry, after being exposed to it since I was a child. I know that I am good at working with codes and hardware. I have a curious nature, i love learning how it all works and is willing to know more. I think it is a great asset to improve for the future. So in every work I do, I seek out possibilities and try it out, find out if it will benefit me or the work I'm working on. It made my work lighter, enjoyable and made me feel fulfilled. 
            </p>      
               <p class="about">Though most of the times I get overly critical of myself. Especially when I finish a project, I can't help but feel that it could've been better even though I usually get positive response	. It often leads me to overwork myself and leave me feeling burned out. Since last year, I tried to look at my achievements (whether it may be small or big) objectively and celebrate it. It helped build my confidence and it improved my work, and most importantly helped me appreciate myself more and other support systems that are always behind me in every work I do.
